Project Name: End-to-End Data Science Project (API/Web App Deployment)

Objectives:
Data Collection: Gather relevant data for model development.
Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and transform data for model training.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using relevant metrics.
Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model as an API or web app using Flask or FastAPI.
Key Points:
Data Collection: Identify and gather datasets suitable for the model.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, normalization, and encoding categorical data.
Machine Learning Model: Use techniques like classification, regression, or clustering depending on the problem at hand.
Deployment: Use Flask or FastAPI to build and deploy the web API for real-time predictions.
Showcase: Create a functional web application or API that demonstrates the model's predictions and capabilities.
Techniques Used:
Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy
Modeling: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras (based on the problem)
Model Evaluation: Cross-validation, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Deployment: Flask or FastAPI for building web applications/APIs
Version Control: Git, GitHub
